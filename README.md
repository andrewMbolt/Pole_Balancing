# Pole_Balancing
Python Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) implementation of the pole balancing problem.

The DPNV_NEAT file generates a model to try and balance the two poles.

The DPNV_Vis file visualizes the resulting motion of the poles given the winning model. 

The DPNV_feb10_winner.mp4 is a visualization of a winning model from a series of evolutionary trails.
